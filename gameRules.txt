In Blackjack, the goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it,
 and to have a hand higher than the dealer's without busting (going over 21). Players and the dealer
 are dealt two cards initially. Players see all their cards, while the dealer has one card face up and
 one face down. Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
 If a player goes over 21, they bust and lose. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.
 If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer stands, the player with the higher hand
 value wins. If the player and dealer tie, it's a push, and bets are returned.
